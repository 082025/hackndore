The Workshop Management System is a web-based application designed to efficiently manage workshops by automating key processes such as registration, scheduling, and attendance tracking. This system provides an admin dashboard for organizers to create, update, and monitor workshop details and participant information seamlessly. Users can register for workshops through a straightforward interface and receive notifications for updates or reminders. Built with a modern tech stack, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and a robust backend powered by Python (Django/Flask) or Node.js, the system integrates with databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL for secure and scalable data management. Future plans for the system include adding analytics dashboards, API integrations for virtual workshops, and possibly developing a mobile application for broader accessibility. This project is a versatile and impactful tool for organizations aiming to streamline their event management processes efficiently.
